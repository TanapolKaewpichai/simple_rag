LangChain is a framework for building applications with LLMs. It allows you to combine retrieval with generation using tools like OpenAI and FAISS.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by letting them access external information. You can use vector stores like FAISS to enable this.

FAISS stands for Facebook AI Similarity Search. It is used to search through large sets of embeddings efficiently.

Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture the meaning and context of the text.

You can visualize these embeddings using t-SNE or PCA to better understand how your chunks are related.
